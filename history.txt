Executing SamaruX external commands
-----------------------------------

Like in previous releases, SamaruX will search the external command files in the
directory specified in the environment variable BINDIR:

	env BINDIR system:

It this variable does not exists, or it's not valid, SamaruX will search the
external command files in the current working directory.

If you prefix the filename with a directory, Samarux will search the external
command file there:

	mescc:cc myprog

New in this release: You can force SamaruX to search a external command file in
the current working directory, if you prefix the filename with the character ':',
as in:

	:cc

Searching manuals with the command man
--------------------------------------

Like in previous releases, SamaruX will seach the manual files in the directory
specified in the environment variable MANPATH:

	env MANPATH manuals:

It this variable does not exists, or it's not valid, SamaruX will search the
manual files in the current working directory.

If you prefix the filename with a directory, Samarux will search the manual
file there:

	man mescc:help stdio

New in this release: You can force SamaruX to search a manual file in the current
working directory, if you prefix the filename with the character ':', as in:

	man :help stdio

New control characters for command line edition:

     CTRL-X (0x18)

To retype the line:

     CTRL-R (0x12)


New environment variables:
--------------------------

- LINES   : Number of console lines.
- COLUMNS : Number of console columns.
- TMPDIR  : Temporary directory (used by pipes).

The use of these environment variables is optional.

When a builtin command asks for a system variable,
the procedure is as follows:

- If the corresponding environment variable exists and
  has a legal value, use it.

- Under CP/M 3, use the value from the SCB.

- Otherwise, use the default values (for the console dimensions,
  the values #defined in the source code; for the temporary
  drive, the current drive).
